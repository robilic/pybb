HOWTO

In the view new_post.html

This line

<form action="{% url 'submit_new_post' %}" method='post'>

Error:

NoReverseMatch at /new_post/
Reverse for 'submit_new_post' not found. 'submit_new_post' is not a valid view function or pattern name.

In the file urls.py add a new line

    url(r'^submit_new_post/', board.views.foobar, name='submit_new_post'),

foobar is the view function that handles 'submit_new_post', they don't need to have the same name.  

You will get this error if this function does not exist in your views.py

AttributeError: module 'board.views' has no attribute 'submit_new_post'



SHELL COMMANDS

python3 manage.py shell

from board.models import Topic, Post, Profile, Forum
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

>>> t = Topic.objects.get(pk=1)
>>> t
<Topic: Black Friday Deals 2017>

>>> Post.objects.filter(topic=t)
<QuerySet [<Post: topic: 1, Walmart has mobil 1 oil for $19.99/quart>, ...

import random
for c in range(1, Topic.objects.count()):
	t = Topic.objects.get(pk=c)
	t.author_id = random.randint(2, User.objects.count())
	t.save()

for c in range(1, Post.objects.count()):
	p = Post.objects.get(pk=c)
	p.author_id = random.randint(2, User.objects.count())
	p.save()
